**Warning: step 4 is risky (if anything goes wrong, you'll have a dead motherboard in worst cases). Do not do these steps unless hibernation feature is vital for you**

1. `/etc/UPower/UPower.conf`

```
CriticalPowerAction=Hibernate
```


2. replace the contents of `/usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/nvidia` with 

```
#!/bin/bash

case $1/$2 in
  pre/*)
    # echo "Going to $2..."
    /usr/bin/echo "0" > /sys/class/vtconsole/vtcon0/bind
    /usr/sbin/rmmod nouveau
    ;;
  post/*)
    # echo "Waking up from $2..."
    /usr/sbin/modprobe nouveau
    /usr/bin/echo "1" > /sys/class/vtconsole/vtcon0/bind
    ;;
esac
```

3. [RISKY STEP] Use https://github.com/DavidS95/Smokeless_UMAF and set Modern Standby Type to `<Modern Standby + s0i2+ s0i3>`
